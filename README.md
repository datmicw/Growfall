## About Growfall

**Growfall** transports you into a 3D realm where you start as a humble, single cube. As you navigate through a vibrant and ever-changing environment, your goal is simple yet thrilling: collect additional squares to grow taller and stronger. Each square you touch stacks onto your cube, increasing its height and giving you a sense of achievement. However, the world is filled with obstacles that threaten your progress—colliding with them causes your cube to lose its hard-earned pieces, shrinking you down and testing your reflexes and decision-making skills. With its clean visuals, fast-paced gameplay, and addictive mechanics, **Growfall** blends simplicity with endless replayability. How tall can you grow before you fall?

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Core Concept
- **Growth**: Your cube begins as a single block. Move it across the map to collect other floating or stationary squares, stacking them vertically to increase your size.
- **Shrinkage**: Obstacles—such as walls, spikes, or moving barriers—will strip away your cubes upon contact, reducing your height and challenging your survival.
- **Balance**: The taller you grow, the harder it becomes to maneuver. Precision and timing are key to mastering the game.

### Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: Achieve the tallest possible cube by collecting squares while avoiding obstacles.
- **Secondary Goal**: Survive as long as possible in a world that grows increasingly treacherous.

### Player Experience
- **Skill-Based**: Success depends on your ability to navigate tight spaces and react quickly.
- **Risk vs. Reward**: Choosing a risky path might yield more squares, but it could also lead to disaster.

## Key Features

- **Unique Growth System**: Watch your cube transform from a single block into a towering structure with every successful collection.
- **Dynamic Environment**: Encounter obstacles that move, rotate, or appear unexpectedly, keeping every run fresh and unpredictable.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Simple 3D graphics with bold colors and smooth animations, designed to focus on gameplay rather than visual overload.
- **Replayability**: Randomized square placements and obstacle patterns ensure no two games are the same.
- **Intuitive Controls**: Easy-to-learn movement that feels natural on both PC and (future) mobile platforms.
